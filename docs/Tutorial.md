### 1.1 Format conversion of genotypic data
MRBIGR supports the conversion of Hapmap/VCF format genotypic data to plink-bed format, as well as the conversion of plink-bed format to VCF format. This function can be called through the parameter `-convert`. The command line is as follows:
```bash
# Hapmap to plink-bed  
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py geno -convert -hapmap MRBIGR_data/chr_HAMP_female.hmp -od MRBIGR_output/demo -o chr_HAMP_female.plink
# plink-bed to VCF  
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py geno -convert -g MRBIGR_output/demo/geno/chr_HAMP_female.plink -od MRBIGR_output/demo -o chr_HAMP_female.vcf
# VCF to plink-bed  
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py geno -convert -vcf MRBIGR_output/demo/geno/chr_HAMP_female.vcf.vcf -od MRBIGR_output/demo -o geno_vcf 
```
The subcommand `geno` invokes the genotypic data analysis module; parameter `-convert` calls the data format conversion function; `-hapmap` and `-vcf` are the correspond format file name; `-g` is the prefix of plink-bed format input data; `-o` is the name of output data; `-od` is the output directory.
### 1.2 Quality control of genotypic data
The raw genotypic data may contain SNPs with low values of MAF (minor allele frequency), high level of missing rate, as well as samples with extreme high missing rate. These data should be filtered before downstream analysis. The `geno` module provides a QC-based genotypic data filter function which can be called through parameter `-qc`. The command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py geno -qc -g MRBIGR_data/chr_HAMP -od MRBIGR_output/demo -o chr_HAMP_qc -maf 0.05 -mis 0.2 -mind 0.2
```
The subcommand geno invokes the genotype analysis module; parameter `-qc` calls the quality control function; `-g` is the plink-bed format input genotypic data; `-o` is the output genotypic data prefix; `-od` is the output directory; `-maf` is the MAF for a SNP to be kept; `-mis` is the maximum proportion of missing values for a SNP to be kept; -mind is the maximum proportion of missing values for a sample to be kept. The parameters `-maf`, `-mis` and `-mind` have default values and are not mandatory.
### 1.3 Fast imputation of missing genotype values
MRBIGR provides several fast and simple methods to impute the missing values in the input genotypic data, either `random` (sampling according to allele frequencies), `mean0` (rounded mean), `mean2` (rounded mean to 2 decimal places), `mode` (most frequent call). It should be noted that these methods are just for fast imputation of test dataset, more accurate imputation of genotypic data should be performed using other professional imputation tools such as Beagle. The command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py geno -imput -method mode -g MRBIGR_output/demo/geno/chr_HAMP_qc_qc -od MRBIGR_output/demo -o geno_impute
```
The subcommand `geno` invokes the genotype analysis module; parameter `-imput` calls the genotype imputation function; `-method` is the imputation method; `-g` is the plink-bed format input genotypic data; `-o` is the output genotypic data prefix (a suffix <font color=blue>_imput</font> will be added automatically for the output files); `-od` is the output directory.
### 1.4 Dimensionality reduction of genotypic data through SNP clumping
SNP clumping is used to keep only one representative SNP per region of LD, which can be used to reduce dimensionality of the genotypic data. This method is proposed in R package bigsnpr, it is similar to the LD-based SNP pruning method in PLINK, but SNP clumping has the advantage of only the SNP with the highest MAF is kept in a LD region and more genetic variation can be kept. The command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py geno -clump -g MRBIGR_data/chr_HAMP -od MRBIGR_output/demo -o chr_HAMP_380k -r 0.7  
```
The subcommand `geno` invokes the genotype analysis module; parameter `-clump` calls the genotype clumping function to keep only one representative SNP per region of LD; `-g` is the plink-bed format input genotypic data, `-o` is the output genotypic data prefix (a suffix <font color=blue>_clump</font> will be added automatically for the output files); `-od` is the output directory.
### 1.5 Calculation of kinship matrix from genotypic data
Pairwise kinship coefficients calculation is used as a measurement of genetic similarity between individuals. MRBIGR can generate a kinship/relatedness matrix by the below command:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py geno -kinship -g MRBIGR_data/chr_HAMP -o chr_HAMP.kinship -od MRBIGR_output/demo
```
The subcommand `geno` invokes the genotype analysis module; parameter `-kinship` calls the kinship calculation function; `-g` is the plink-bed format input genotypic data, `-o` is the output file prefix. The output file <font color=blue>kinship.cXX.txt</font> could be found in a directory named output; `-od` is the output directory.
### 1.6 Principle component analysis from genotypic data
Principal components analysis (PCA) is commonly applied to population structure inference and dimension reduction of the data. Top PCs calculated from the genotypic data can reflect population structure among the sample individuals. MRBIGR can perform PCA analysis by the below command:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py geno -pca -g MRBIGR_data/chr_HAMP -o chr_HAMP.geno -dim 10 -od MRBIGR_output/demo 
```
The subcommand `geno` invokes the genotype analysis module; parameter `-pca` calls the PCA analysis function; `-g` is the plink-bed format input genotypic data; `-o` is the output file prefix; `-od` is the output directory; `-dim` is the dimensionality or PCs for the output data, with a default value 10. Then, a CSV format output file named <font color=blue>chr_HAMP.geno_pc.csv</font> would be generated.
### 1.7 t-SNE analysis from genotypic data
t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a machine learning algorithm for dimensional reduction. As a nonlinear dimensional reduction algorithm, t-SNE performs better than PCA, and is suitable for visualization of population structure. MRBIGR first use PCA to reduce the data to 50 dimensions, and then use t-SNE algorithm to further reduced the data to 2 or 3 dimensions. The command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py geno -tsne -g MRBIGR_data/chr_HAMP -o chr_HAMP.geno -dim 3 -od MRBIGR_output/demo
```
The subcommand `geno` invokes the genotype analysis module; parameter `-tsne` calls the t-SNE analysis function; `-g` is the plink-bed format input genotypic data; `-o` is the output file prefix; `-od` is the output directory; `-dim` is the dimensionality for the output data, usually 2 or 3, with a default value 3. Then, a CSV format output file named <font color=blue>geno_tsne.csv</font> would be generated.
### 1.8 Phylogenetic analysis from genotypic data
MRBIGR introduces a one-step phylogenetic analysis function from genotypic data, which facilitate the visualization of relatedness of individuals and population structure. A nwk format maximum likelihood (ML) tree can be generated follow this command:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py geno -tree -g MRBIGR_output/demo/geno/chr_HAMP_380k_clump -o chr_HAMP_380k_clump.geno_tree -od MRBIGR_output/demo  
```
The subcommand `geno` invokes the genotype analysis module; parameter `-tree` calls the phylogenetic analysis function; `-g` is the plink-bed format input genotypic data; `-o` is the output file prefix; `-od` is the output directory. Then, a nwk format output file named <font color=blue>geno_tree.tree.nwk</font>  and some other related files <font color=blue>ggeno_tree.*</font>  would be generated.
### 1.9 Functional annotation of genotypic data
This function in MRBIGR is relied on ANNOVAR, an efficient software tool to utilize update-to-date information to functionally annotate genetic variants. Only `vcf-format` genotypic data is supported as input, plink-bed format genotypic data should be converted to VCF format using the `-convert` function. If annotation is performed for the first time, an annotation database should be built by adding the parameters `-gtf` and `-fa`. The command line is as follows:
```bash
gunzip -k MRBIGR_data/Zea_mays.B73_RefGen_v4.50.gtf.gz
gunzip -k MRBIGR_data/Zea_mays.B73_RefGen_v4.dna.toplevel.fa.gz

docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py geno -anno -vcf MRBIGR_output/demo/geno/chr_HAMP_female.vcf.vcf -o chr_HAMP_female.vcf_anno -od MRBIGR_output/demo -db ZmB73 -dbdir MRBIGR_output/demo/geno/ref -gtf MRBIGR_data/Zea_mays.B73_RefGen_v4.50.gtf -fa MRBIGR_data/Zea_mays.B73_RefGen_v4.dna.toplevel.fa 
```
The subcommand `geno` invokes the genotype analysis module; parameter `-anno` calls the annotation function; `-vcf` is the vcf-format input genotypic data; `-o` is the output file prefix; `-od` is the output directory; `-db` is the output database name; `-dbdir` is the output database directory; `-fa` is the reference genome sequences file in FASTA format; `-gtf` is the reference gene annotation file in GTF format. Then, MRBIGR would generate an annotation database and perform functional annotate for genetic variants automatically. The output annotation result files include <font color=blue>testvcf_anno.ZmB73_multianno.vcf, testvcf_anno.ZmB73_multianno.bed, and testvcf_anno.ZmB73_largeEffect.bed.</font> If the annotation database has been built before, the parameters `-gtf` and `-fa` are no longer need, and the parameters `-db` and `-dbdir` are the input database name and database directory, respectively. In this case, the command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py geno -anno -vcf MRBIGR_output/demo/geno/chr_HAMP_female.vcf.vcf -o chr_HAMP_female.vcf_anno -od MRBIGR_output/demo -db ZmB73 -dbdir MRBIGR_output/demo/geno/ref
```

```

### 2.1 Quality control of phenotypic data
Quality control of the original phenotypic data include transposition of the original phenotype matrix if needed, removal of outlier data points based on z-score or boxplot methods, filtering traits with high level of missing rate and low average values. In this function, either of the parameters `-tr`, `-rout`, `-mis` and `-val` is optional. If you want to perform quality control use all the default parameters, the command line looks like this
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py pheno -qc -p MRBIGR_data/blup_traits_final.new.csv -o blup_traits_final.qc -od MRBIGR_output/demo -rout zscore -mis 0.1 -val 0.1  
```
The subcommand `pheno` invokes the phenotype analysis module; parameter `-qc` calls the quality control function; `-p` is the input phenotype matrix; `-o` is the prefix of output file; `-mis` is the missing rate cutoff with default value 0.5; `-val` is the small value cutoff with default value 0.1; `-rout` means outlier removal of phenotypic values with the default method z-score. If you want to perform quality control use personalized parameters, the command line could be as follows:
```bash
# transposition of the original phenotype matrix  
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py pheno -qc -tr -p MRBIGR_data/blup_traits_final.new.csv -o blup_traits_final.tr -od MRBIGR_output/demo  
# reset missing rate cutoff, skip small value filter and outlier removal  
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py pheno -qc -p MRBIGR_data/blup_traits_final.new.csv -o blup_traits_final.qc -mis 0.1 -od MRBIGR_output/demo  
# skip small value filter and set outlier removal method to boxplot  
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py pheno -qc -p MRBIGR_data/blup_traits_final.new.csv -o blup_traits_final.qc -rout boxplot -mis 0.1 -od MRBIGR_output/demo 
```
### 2.2 Imputation of missing phenotype values
There are three different phenotype imputation methods provided by MRBIGR: `mean`, `median`, `most_frequent`. The missing phenotype values in input file should be defined as NA, and the command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py pheno -imput -p MRBIGR_output/demo/pheno/blup_traits_final.qc.phe.csv -o blup_traits_final.qc.imput -od MRBIGR_output/demo -method most_frequent  
```
The subcommand `pheno` invokes the phenotype analysis module; parameter `-imput` calls the phenotype imputation function; `-p` is the input phenotype matrix; `-o` is the prefix of output file; `-method` is the imputation method. After this step, a phenotype file named <font color=blue>pheno_imput.phe.csv</font> with no missing value would be generated.
### 2.3 Scaling and normalization of phenotypic data
MRBIGR provides multiple commonly used phenotypic data scaling and normalization methods, such as logarithmization, z-score standarlization, box-cox normalization, normal quantile normalization. These scaling and normalization methods are applicable to different types of phenotypic data, like agronomic traits, transcripts expression data, metabolites intensity data. The command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py pheno -scale -p MRBIGR_output/demo/pheno/blup_traits_final.qc.imput.phe.csv -o blup_traits_final.qc.imput.norm -od MRBIGR_output/demo -boxcox -minmax
```
The subcommand `pheno` invokes the phenotype analysis module; parameter `-scale` calls the phenotype scaling/normalization/standardization/transformation function; `-p` is the input phenotype matrix; `-o` is the prefix of output file; `-boxcox` and `-minmax` means use both Box-Cox and Min-Max methods to transform the data. Box-Cox transformation is used to transform each trait to meet normality assumptions, a lambda is calculated per trait and used to transform each trait, while Min-Max scaling is used to scale the values to 0-1. Other optional methods are `-log2`，`-log10`，`-ln`，`-qqnorm`，`-zscore`，and `-robust`.
### 2.4 Correction of phenotypic data base on population structure
Since population structure may lead to phenotypic data distributed in different levels, in some cases, correction of phenotype values to the same level based on population structure may help downstream analysis. The `-correct` function in MRBIGR use a PCA file, which can be generated through genotypic data, to perform phenotypic data correction. The command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py pheno -correct -p MRBIGR_output/demo/pheno/blup_traits_final.qc.imput.phe.csv -o blup_traits_final.qc.imput.pca_correct -od MRBIGR_output/demo -pca MRBIGR_output/demo/geno/chr_HAMP.geno_pca.csv 
```
The subcommand `pheno` invokes the phenotype analysis module; parameter `-correct` calls the phenotype correct function; `-p` is the input phenotype matrix; `-o` is the output file prefix; `-pca` is the PCA result file generated by genotypic data through the command `geno -pca`. 
### 2.5 Merge the phenotype values from different environment
Phenotypic data form different environment or years need to be merged before downstream analysis, commonly used phenotypic data merge algorithms are mean-value, BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) and BLUE (best linear unbiased estimation). MRBIGR provides all three methods for this purpose, which can be called and selected from parameters `-merge` and `-mm`. It is noted that only one trait is accepted in an input file. The command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py pheno -merge -p MRBIGR_data/blup_traits_final.new.csv -o blup_traits_final.blup -od MRBIGR_output/demo -mm blup 
```
The subcommand `pheno` invokes the phenotype analysis module; parameter `-merge` calls the phenotype merge function; `-p` is the input phenotype matrix for a trait in CSV format;`-o` is the prefix of output file; `-mm` is the merge method. After this step, a phenotype file named <font color=blue>blup_traits_final.blup.phe.csv</font> with BLUP merged phenotypic values would be generated.

### 3.1 Parallel GWAS
MRBIGR support parallel GWAS for multiple traits. Take the processed plink-bed format genotypic data and CSV format phenotypic data as inputs, GWAS can be performed through the below command:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py gwas -gwas -model gemma_mlm -thread 12 -g MRBIGR_data/chr_HAMP -p MRBIGR_data/AMP_kernel_transcriptome_v4 -od MRBIGR_output/demo
```
The subcommand `gwas` invokes the GWAS and SAL analysis module; parameter `-gwas` calls the GWAS function which utilizes `GEMMA`(default), `GAPIT` or `rMVP` to perform GWAS; `-model` is the model to fit, with `gemma_lm`, `gemma_mlm`, `rmvp_glm`, `rmvp_mlm`, `rmvp_farmcpu`, `gapit_glm`, `gapit_mlm`, `gapit_cmlm`, `gapit_mmlm`, `gapit_farmcpu`, and `gapit_blink` as options; `-thread` is the thread number to run the command; `-g` is the plink-bed format input genotypic data; `-p` is the CSV format phenotypic data; `-od` is the output directory. After this step, an output directory named `MRBIGR_output/demo/gwas/gemma/lmm` would be generated with the GWAS result files named <font color=blue>Zm00001dxxxxx.assoc.txt</font> in it. 

__Note: the exact output directory is depend on the model you selected, where `-model gemma_mlm` means the final output directory will be `MRBIGR_output/demo/gwas/gemma/lmm`__.

### 3.2 Parallel SAL detection based on GWAS results
MRBIGR introduces the clumped method implemented in PLINK v1.9 to automatically detect and optimize SALs based on the original GWAS results. In detail, a stricter P-value threshold `-p1` is set to uncover the significantly associated SNPs; then,  for each significantly associated SNP, if the other SNPs within a 500 kb distance have P-values smaller than the second looser P-value threshold `-p2`, and have r2 values greater than 0.2 with the index SNP, as well as the number of such SNPs surpass the SNP number threshold `-p2n`, then the region is regarded as a SAL; finally, all overlapping SALs are merged to generate the final SAL set, while the SNP with the smallest P-value in a SAL is defined as a lead SNP.The command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py gwas -qtl -g MRBIGR_data/chr_HAMP -thread 6 -i MRBIGR_output/demo/gwas/gemma/lmm -o qtl_output -od MRBIGR_output/demo -p1 1e-5 -p2 1e-3 -p2n 5 
```
The subcommand gwas invokes the GWAS and SAL analysis module; parameter `-qtl` calls the SAL detection function; `-thread` is the thread number to run the command; `-i` is the GWAS result directory; `-o` is the output file prefix; `-od` is the output directory; `-p1` is the significance threshold for index SNPs used to determine SALs; `-p2` is the secondary significance threshold for clumped SNPs used to determine the reliability of SALs; `-p2n` is secondary significance SNP number in a SAL. After this step, an output file named <font color=blue>qtl_output.qtl_res.csv</font> would be generated.
### 3.3 Annotation of SAL regions
The SAL result file could be annotated use a four columns gene annotation file in TSV format, which looks like this:
```shell
geneid  aliased position        function
Zm00001d027230  Zm00001d027230  1:44289-49837:+ Zm00001d027230
Zm00001d027231  Zm00001d027231  1:50877-55716:- Zm00001d027231
Zm00001d027232  Zm00001d027232  1:92299-95134:- Zm00001d027232
Zm00001d027233  Zm00001d027233  1:111655-118312:-       Zm00001d027233
```
This file could be generated from a standard GTF format gene annotation file through the follow command:
```shell
mkdir MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/
grep -v '#' MRBIGR_data/Zea_mays.B73_RefGen_v4.50.gtf |awk '{if($3=="gene"){print $0}}' |sed 's/ /\t/g'|sed 's/"//g'|sed 's/;//g'|awk '{print $10"\t"$10"\t"$1":"$4"-"$5":"$7"\t"$10}'|sed '1igeneid\taliased\tposition\tfunction' > MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/gene.anno.tsv
```
Then, take this file as input, SAL annotation could be performed use follow the command:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py gwas -anno -q MRBIGR_output/demo/gwas/qtl/qtl_output.qtl_res.csv -a MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/gene.anno.tsv -o anno_output -od MRBIGR_output/demo
```
The subcommand `gwas` invokes the GWAS and SAL analysis module; parameter `-anno` calls the SAL annotation function; `-q` is the input SAL result file for annotation file; `-o` is the prefix of output file. After this step, an output file named <font color=blue>anno_output.qtl_anno.csv</font> would be generate.
### 3.4 Visualization of GWAS results
Manhattan-plots and QQ-plots can be generated for the visualization purpose of the GWAS results. The command line is as follows: 
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py gwas -visual -thread 12 -i MRBIGR_output/demo/gwas/gemma/lmm -od MRBIGR_output/demo 
```
or
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py gwas -visual -thread 12 -i MRBIGR_output/demo/gwas/gemma/lmm -od MRBIGR_output/demo -multi -q MRBIGR_output/demo/gwas/qtl/qtl_output.qtl_res.csv
```
The subcommand `gwas` invokes the GWAS and SAL analysis module; parameter `-visual` calls the visualization function; `-i` is the GWAS result directory; `-od` is the output directory; `-multi` is optional, with a multi-trait Manhattan-plot would be generate when set; `-q` is the input SAL result file, it only need to be set when `-multi` is set; `-thread` is the thread number to run the command.
### 3.5 Statistical test of lead SNP
A simple approach to establish the relationship of phenotype distribution and SAL haplotype type is to use genotype of the lead SNP to represent the haplotype type of the SAL region, then, phenotype values distribution under different genotype of the lead SNP could be displayed, and student’s test could be performed. This simple statistical test can be performed in MRBIGR through the command below:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py gwas -peaktest -o peaktest_output -od MRBIGR_output/demo -p MRBIGR_data/AMP_kernel_transcriptome_v4 -g MRBIGR_data/chr_HAMP -q MRBIGR_output/demo/gwas/qtl/qtl_output.qtl_res.csv  
```
The subcommand `gwas` invokes the GWAS and SAL analysis module; parameter -peaktest calls the peak test function; `-o` is the prefix of output file; `-od` is the output directory; `-p` is the input phenotypic data; `-g` is the input genotypic data; `-q` is the input SAL result file. Then, genotype information of each sample and phenotype distribution plot would be generated in the output directory.
### 3.6 Statistical test of genes
Another approach to establish the relationship of phenotype distribution and SAL haplotype is to test the phenotype distribution and haplotype type for each gene in the SAL, to discover potential casual gene and variants. For a SAL region, MRBIGR uses large effect variants in each gene to build gene haplotypes, and perform gene based haplotype test. Welch’s test was used for a two-group haplotype test and a Tukey’s test was used for a multiple group haplotype test as described in _Yano et al, 2016_. The command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py gwas -genetest -f1 MRBIGR_output/demo/gwas/anno/anno_output.qtl_anno.csv -f2 MRBIGR_output/demo/geno/chr_HAMP_female.vcf_anno.ZmB73_multianno.bed -vcf MRBIGR_output/demo/geno/chr_HAMP_female.vcf.vcf -p MRBIGR_data/blup_traits_final.new.csv -od MRBIGR_output/demo
```
The subcommand gwas invokes the GWAS and SAL analysis module; parameter `-genetest` calls the gene test function; `-f1` is the input SAL annotation file generated by gwas `-anno` command; `-f2` is the input genotype annotation file generated by geno `-anno` command; `-p` is the input phenotype file; `-od` is the output directory. Then, related gene haplotype information of each sample and phenotype distribution plot would be generated in the `MRBIGR_output/demo/gwas/gene_haplotest` directory.

## 4. Mendelian randomization analysis of multi-omics data
The Mendelian randomization analysis module can be utilized for perform Mendelian randomization analysis between different omics data, this module can be invoked through the subcommand `mr`, which includes 3 modes according to parameters. The first mode provides input omics data through the `-exposure` and `-outcome` parameters, and performs Mendelian randomization analysis between `-exposure` data and `-outcome` data; the second mode provides transcriptome expression data through the `-gene_exp` parameter, and perform Mendelian randomization analysis between gene pairs through the `-pairwise` parameter; the third mode provides transcriptome expression data through the `-gene_exp` parameter, the `-tf` parameter provides the annotation information of the transcription factor, and `-target` provides the transcription factor target gene annotation information, and then perform Mendelian randomization analysis between transcription factors and target genes. There are two calculation models for Mendelian randomization, linear model and mixed linear model, respectively, specified by the parameters `-lm` and `-mlm`.

```

### 4.1 Exposure/outcome Mode
The first mode uses the `-exposure` parameter to specify the exposure data required by the Mendelian randomization model, `-outcome` provides the outcome data required by the Mendelian randomization model, and `-qtl` provides the genetic variation of the exposure data, then Mendelian randomization analysis can be performed through the below command:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py mr -g MRBIGR_data/chr_HAMP -exposure MRBIGR_data/AMP_kernel_transcriptome_v4 -qtl MRBIGR_output/demo/gwas/qtl/qtl_output.qtl_res.csv -outcome MRBIGR_data/blup_traits_final.new.csv -mlm -thread 12 -o g2p -od MRBIGR_output/demo 
```
The subcommand `mr` invokes the Mendelian randomization analysis module; parameter `-exposure` is the CSV format exposure data; `-outcome` is the CSV format outcome data; `-qtl` is the CSV format exposure SAL data; `-thread` is the thread number to run the command; `-g` is the plink-bed format input genotypic data; `-mlm` represents perform Mendelian randomization analysis through mixed linear model; `-o` is the prefix of output file; `-od` is the output directory. After this step, a MR result file named <font color=blue>g2p.MR.csv</font> would be generated.
### 4.2 Pairwise Mode
The second mode uses the `-gene_exp` parameter to specify the population gene expression data, `-qtl` specifies the genetic variation that affects gene expression, and `-pairwise` indicates to perform Mendelian randomization analysis between all pairs of genes in the population gene expression data, pairwise genes Mendelian randomization analysis can be performed through the below command:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py mr -g MRBIGR_data/chr_HAMP -gene_exp MRBIGR_data/AMP_kernel_transcriptome_v4 -pairwise -mlm -qtl MRBIGR_output/demo/gwas/qtl/qtl_output.qtl_res.csv -thread 12 -o gene_pairwise_mr_out -od MRBIGR_output/demo 
```
The subcommand `mr` invokes the Mendelian randomization analysis module; parameter `-gene_exp` is the CSV format population gene expression data; `-qtl` is the CSV format gene SAL data; `-thread` is the thread number to run the command; `-g` is the plink-bed format input genotypic data; `-mlm` represents perform Mendelian randomization analysis through mixed linear model; `-o` is the prefix of output file. After this step, a MR result file named <font color=blue>gene_pairwise_mr_out.MR.csv</font> would be generated.
### 4.3 TF Mode
The third mode uses the `-gene_exp` parameter to specify the population expression data while using the `-tf` and `-target` parameters to specify the transcription factor and their target genes, respectively, and then perform Mendelian randomization analysis between the transcription factors and the target genes. The regulatory relationship between transcription factors and target genes can be divided into direct and indirect regulatory relationships. In detail, when the genomic distance between a transcription factor and its target gene is < 500 kb, the relationship between them is defined as direct relationship, while the regulatory relationship between the transcription factor and remaining target genes are defined as indirect regulation. The `-type` parameter is used to specify the regulatory relationship between transcription factors and target genes in Mendelian randomization analysis. The command line is as follows:
```bash
head -100 MRBIGR_data/gene.anno.tsv > MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/test_head100_genefunc.txt
tail -100 MRBIGR_data/gene.anno.tsv > MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/test_tail100_genefunc.txt

docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py mr -g MRBIGR_data/chr_HAMP -gene_exp MRBIGR_data/AMP_kernel_transcriptome_v4 -tf MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/test_head100_genefunc.txt -target MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/test_tail100_genefunc.txt -mlm -qtl MRBIGR_output/demo/gwas/qtl/qtl_output.qtl_res.csv -threads 12 -o tf_test_mr_out -od MRBIGR_output/demo  
```
The subcommand `mr` invokes the Mendelian randomization analysis module; parameter `-gene_exp` is the CSV format population gene expression data; `-qtl` is the CSV format transcription factor SAL data; `-tf` is the transcription factor annotation file; `-target` is the annotation files for genes targeted by transcription factors; `-thread` is the thread number to run the command; `-g` is the plink-bed format input genotypic data; `-mlm` represents perform Mendelian randomization analysis through mixed linear model; `-type` is the regulatory relationship between transcription factors and target genes, with either direct (perform Mendelian randomization analysis transcription factors and directly regulated targeted genes) or all (perform Mendelian randomization analysis between transcription factors and all targeted genes) as option; `-o` is the prefix of output file; `-od` is the output directory. After this step, a MR result file named <font color=blue>tf_test_mr_out.MR.csv</font> would be generated.</br>

![#5A9AB9](img/tips@3x.png)__Tips__: The transcription factor annotation file and the annotation files for genes targeted by 
transcription factors could be annotated use a four columns gene annotation file in TSV format, 
which looks like this (take `MRBIGR_data/gene.anno.tsv` as example):  
```bash
geneid  aliased position        function
Zm00001d027230  Zm00001d027230  1:44289-49837:+ Zm00001d027230

## 5. MR-based network construction and module identification
In MRBIGR, the weight of MR effects between gene pairs are used to construct the MR-based network and ClusterONE algorithm is used to identify modules for the constructed network, which can be invoked through the subcommand `net`:

```bash
$ docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py net -h
usage: MRBIGR.py net [options]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -mr                  pairwise Mendelian Randomization analysis result
  -module_size [5]     minimal size of genes in a module,default 5
  -pvalue [1e-3]       pvalue cutoff for MR-based network analysis,default
                       1e-3
  -plot                plot network of each module

  -o [net_out]         The prefix of the output file, default go_out
  -od [output_dir]     Directory of the output files.
```
 The MR-based network analysis command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py net -mr MRBIGR_output/demo/mr/gene_pairwise_mr_out.MR.csv -plot -o net_out -od MRBIGR_output/demo 
```
The subcommand `net` invokes the Mendelian randomization based network analysis module; parameter `-mr` is the CSV format Mendelian randomization analysis data; `-plot` represents plot network for each identified network module; `-o` is the prefix of output file; `-od` is the output directory. After this step, network edgelist file <font color=blue>net_out.edge_list</font>, ClusterONE software result <font color=blue>net_out.clusterone.result.csv</font>, network module plot <font color=blue>net_out.module*.pdf</font> and final network module file <font color=blue>net_out.module.csv</font> would be generated.

## 6. Gene ontology analysis of network modules
Gene ontology analysis of the MR-based network modules is helpful to find modules with biological significance. The enrichGO function in R package clusterProfiler is used to perform GO enrichment analysis on each module based on gene ontology annotation, and rich graphics (e.g., `dotplot`, `barplot`, `cnetplot`, `heatplot`, `emapplot`, `upsetplot`) could be chose for the visualization of the enrichment results. Gene ontology analysis can be invoked through the subcommand `go`:
```bash
$ docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py go -h
usage: MRBIGR.py go [options]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -gene_lists           gene lists file for GO enrichment analysis
  -go_anno              GO annotation file for each gene used to construct GO
                        annotation database

  -plot_type [dotplot]  Visualization types of GO enrichment result, support
                        barplot, dotplot, Gene-Concept Network(cnetplot),
                        heatplot, Enrichment Map(emapplot) and upsetplot, one
                        or more plot types can be specified at the same time,
                        multiple types are separated by commas, such as
                        barplot,emapplot,heatplot
  -plot_fmt [jpg,pdf]   The format of the output plots
  -o [go_out]           The prefix of the output file, default go_out
  -od [output_dir]      Directory of the output files.
```

The analysis command line is as follows:
```bash
csvtk sep -f 3 -t MRBIGR_data/gene.anno.tsv -s ":" -n chr,start-end,strand | csvtk sep -f start-end -t -s "-" -n start,end | csvtk cut -f 1,5,8,9,7,2 -t | csvtk rename -t -f 1-6 -n "gene_id,chr,start,end,stard,annotation" -o MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/gene_anno.txt

docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py go -gene_lists MRBIGR_output/demo/net/net_out.module.csv -go_anno MRBIGR_data/maize.genes2go.txt -gene_info MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/gene_anno.txt -plot_type barplot,dotplot -o go_out -od MRBIGR_output/demo  
```
The subcommand `go` invokes the gene ontology enrichment analysis module; parameter `-gene_lists` is the CSV format network module data; `-go` is the Tabular format gene ontology annotation of each gene data; `-gene_info` is the Tabular format gene annotation data; `-plot_type` is visualization type of enrichment results; `-o` is the prefix of output file; `-od` is the output directory. After this step, gene ontology enrichment analysis result <font color=blue>go_out.GO.csv</font>, visualized results of functional enrichment results <font color=blue>go_out.BP.dotplot.pdf</font> , <font color=blue>go_out.MF.dotplot.pdf</font> and <font color=blue>go_out.CC.dotplot.pdf</font> , <font color=blue>go_out.BP.barplot.pdf</font> , <font color=blue>go_out.MF.barplot.pdf</font> and <font color=blue>go_out.CC.barplot.pdf</font> would be generated.

![#5A9AB9](img/tips@3x.png)__Tips__: The gene ontology annotation information of each gene could be annotated use a two 
columns annotation file in TSV format, which looks like this (take `MRBIGR_data/maize.genes2go.txt` as example): 
```bash
Zm00001d018305  GO:0051649  
Zm00001d018305  GO:0003677  
Zm00001d003209  GO:0005886  
Zm00001d003209  GO:0044238  
```
The gene annotation information of each gene could by annotated use a five columns annotation file 
in TSV format, which looks like this (take `MRBIGR_data/maize_genefunc.txt` as example):  
```bash
gene_id chr start   end stard   annotation  
Zm00001d027230  1   44289   49837   +   Mitochondrial transcription termination factor family protein  
Zm00001d027231  1   50877   55716   -   OSJNBa0093O08.6 protein

### 7.1 Genotypic data based plot
The genotypic data based plot includes SNP density plot (`SNPdensity`) and scatterplot of population (`scatter_ps`). SNP density plot is used to demonstrate the distribution of the SNP across the genome. The command line is as follows: 
```bash
csvtk cut -f 2,1,4 -t MRBIGR_data/chr_HAMP.bim -H | csvtk add-header -t -n "rs,chr,ps" -o MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/snp_info.txt
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py plot plot_old -i MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/snp_info.txt -plot_type SNPdensity -o plot_out -od MRBIGR_output/demo  
```

![#5A9AB9](img/tips@3x.png)__Tips__: The SNP information file could be annotated use a three columns file in TSV format, which 
looks like this (take generated `MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/snp_info.txt` as example): 

```bash
rs  chr ps  
chr10.s_109149  10  109149  
chr10.s_109277  10  109277  
chr10.s_109475  10  109475

```
The first column represents the SNP id, the second column represents the chromosome of the SNP, and the third column represents the position of the SNP.
The population scatterplot takes a PCA or t-SNE result file as input to visualize the population structure. The population information of each individual can be specified by the -group parameter, which is used to assign individuals to populations with different colors. The command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py plot plot_old -i MRBIGR_output/demo/geno/chr_HAMP.geno_pca.csv -plot_type scatter_ps -group MRBIGR_data/491.group_info.csv -o plot_out -od MRBIGR_output/demo
```
The population structure file could be annotated use a three columns file in CSV format, which looks like this (take `MRBIGR_output/demo/geno/chr_HAMP.geno_pca.csv` as example):

The first column represents the ID of SNPs, the second column represents the chromosome of SNPs, and the third column represents the position of SNPs, the fourth column represents the GWAS P-value of SNPs.
### 7.4 MR data based plot
The MR based plot includes forest plot (`forestplot`) and scatter plot (`scatter_mr`). The forest plot is used to display the effect between each exposure and outcome traits, and can specify the order of the outcome traits in the forest plot through the order file, so as to compare the effects of different exposures on the outcome traits. It can be used to compare the influence of different exposures under a small number of outcome traits. The command line is as follows:
```bash
csvtk cut -f 2 MRBIGR_output/demo/mr/g2p.MR.csv -U | sort -u | head -20 | csvtk grep -P - -f 2 MRBIGR_output/demo/mr/g2p.MR.csv -o MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/example.g2p.MR.csv
head -1 MRBIGR_data/blup_traits_final.new.csv | csvtk transpose | sed '1d' > MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/example_trait.order.txt
docker exec -it mrbigr_env plot -i MRBIGR_output/demo/mr/example.g2p.MR.csv -plot_type forestplot -order MRBIGR_output/demo/tmp/example_trait.order.txt -o plot_out -od MRBIGR_output/demo
```
![#5A9AB9](img/tips@3x.png)__Tips__: The MR file is generated by `mr` subcommand. The order file is a one column file that list outcome traits, which looks like this (take the traits in `MRBIGR_data/blup_traits_final.new.csv` as example): </br>
```bash
Plantheight
Earheight
Earleafwidth
Earleaflength
Tasselmainaxislength
Tasselbranchnumber
Leafnumberaboveear
Earlength
Eardiameter
Cobdiameter
Kernernumberperrow
100grainweight
cobweight
Kernelwidth
Silkingtime
Pollenshed
Headingdate 
```
The scatter plot is used to display the Mendelian randomized p-value between exposure and outcome, and group the outcome through the group file. It can be used to show the impact of exposure on the outcome traits under a large number of outcome traits. The command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env MRBIGR.py plot plot_old -i MRBIGR_output/demo/mr/g2p.MR.csv -plot_type scatter_mr -group MRBIGR_data/genes.grp -o plot_out -od MRBIGR_output/demo
```

![#5A9AB9](img/tips@3x.png)__Tips__: The group file of outcome traits could be annotated use a two columns annotation file in CSV format, which looks like this (take `MRBIGR_data/genes.grp` as example):  
```bash
id,group
Zm00001d027230,1
Zm00001d027231,1
Zm00001d027232,1
Zm00001d027233,1
Zm00001d027234,1 
...
```
The first column represents the outcome trait, and the second column represents the category corresponding to the outcome trait, which can be the chromosome where the gene is located, the type of metabolite, etc.
### 7.5 GO based plot
The GO based plot includes bar plot (`barplot`) and dot plot (`dotplot`). It depicts the enrichment scores (e.g. P-values) and gene count or ratio in plot. The command line is as follows:
```bash
docker exec -it mrbigr_env plot -i MRBIGR_output/demo/go/go_out.GO.csv -plot_type barplot -o plot_out -od MRBIGR_output/demo
docker exec -it mrbigr_env plot -i MRBIGR_output/demo/go/go_out.GO.csv -plot_type dotplot -o plot_out -od MRBIGR_output/demo
```

![#5A9AB9](img/tips@3x.png)__Tips__:The GO enrichment result file could be annotated use a ten columns file in CSV format,
which looks like this:  
```bash
ONTOLOGY,ID,Description,GeneRatio,BgRatio,pvalue,p.adjust,qvalue,geneID,Count  
MF,GO:0003729,mRNA binding,5/82,371/37229,1.393e-3,0.033,0.026,Zm00001d044979/Zm00001d049442/Zm00001d005350,5 
...
```
The first column represents the ontology domains, including BP, MF and CC, the second column represents the ontology id, the third column represents the description of ontology id, the fourth column represents the ratio of genes containing ontology id in the gene list to the total genes in the gene list, the fifth column represents the ratio of genes containing ontology id in whole genome to the total genes in whole genome, the sixth column represents the P value of GO enrichment analysis, the seventh and eighth columns represents the corrected P value of GO enrichment analysis, it can be same when the GO enrichment result file is user-customized, the ninth column represents the gene id of genes containing ontology id, the tenth represents the count of genes containing ontology id.
